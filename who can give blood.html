<h2>Blood Donation Rules</h2>
<p1>You must be 18 years old or have parental permission if you’re 16 or 17.</p1><br>
<p2>You must weigh 120 pounds or more.</p2><br>
<p3>You need a valid driver’s license or a passport for identification.</p3><br>
<p4>You must be free of any major organ disease, including heart disease, lung disease and bleeding tendencies.</p4><br>
<p5>You must not be taking antibiotics or other supplements that could influence the donation.</p5><br>
<p6>You must wait 12 months if you had a tattoo applied in a state that does not regulate tattoo facilities. That includes District of Columbia, Georgia, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Utah and Wyoming.</p6><br>
<p7>Recent surgery or travel may mean deferral. </p7><br>
<p8>Baker says the most common reason someone is unable to donate is because of low hemoglobin. Acceptable hemoglobin is 13.0 grams/deciliter for males and 12.5 grams/deciliter for females.</p8><br>
<p9>“You need iron to make new red cells to maintain your hemoglobin. Eating foods high in iron, such as fortified cereals and grains, spinach, green lentils, beans, nuts and many other foods can help,” Baker says.</p9><br>

<p10>For any questions you may have on blood donation rules, Baker encourages checking your local blood center’s website or giving them a call.</p10>
