<h1><center>Why To Donate Blood</center><h1>
<h2>It Saves Lives</h2>
<p1>Donations are essential for trauma patients and people undergoing a variety of situations, including surgeries, transplants, chronic illnesses, blood disorders and cancer. Because over 90% of people who are eligible to donate do not, Baker says there’s always a need for donors.</p1>
<br>
<p2>“Life-saving blood components can support recovery from injuries or disease,” Baker says. “A single blood donation can give one to four patients a better outcome, a chance at survival.”</p2>
<br>
<h3>It’s Only an Hour of Your Time</h3>
<p3>The entire donation process takes approximately one hour, with about 10 minutes of that time being the actual blood donation. The whole blood donation volume is usually about 500 milliliters, or one pint.

“Eat a meal or snack before you plan donate, and don’t donate if you aren’t feeling well. After you finish, you’ll get a beverage and snack to replace volume,” Baker says.</p3>
